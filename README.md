# Practice: List Employees Working at a Company

## Instructions
Using C# classes, you need to create custom types to represent an Employee and a Company. Then you will create some employees, hire them into the company and then display a simple report showing the employee names and their titles.

1. Create a custom type for Employee. An employee has the following properties.
    - First name (string)
    - Last name (string)
    - Title (string)
    - Start date (DateTime)
1. Create a custom type for Company. A company has the following properties.
    - Date founded (DateTime)
    - Company name (string)
    - Employees (List<Employee>)
1. The Company class should also have a ListEmployees() method which outputs the name of each employee to the console.
1. In the Main method of your console application, create a new instance of Company, and three instances of Employee. Then assign the employees to the company.


### Results will appear in the console
